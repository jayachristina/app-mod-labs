# Demonstrating App Modernization with Customers

This demo aims to showcase how to modernize applications for solving the challenges faced by existing applications in the current landscape as below:

* **Integration**: Challenging to leverage new cloud based services
* **Scalability**: Not able to meet web scale due to data-centric architecture
* **Reliability**: Unable to quickly deploy new capabilities
* **Developer productivity and Business Agility**: Often low in comparison to cloud native applications

Take a look at the [Konveyor Communityâ€™s Application Modernization Report for 2022](https://www.konveyor.io/modernization-report/) to understand how users and organizations define application modernization as well as top reasons for modernization.
